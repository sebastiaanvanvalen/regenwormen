so we are making this game in the first place for a friend. Or actually me. Because it turned out this is THE game where I can finaly beat him by rockhard old fashion luck.

At this point I need to search for bugs and optimalisations. So what came up:

errors:
- no player has won / it's a tie solution is made



optimalisations:
- cross browser checks
