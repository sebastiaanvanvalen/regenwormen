so we are making this game in the first place for a friend. Or actually me. Because it turned out this is THE game where I can finaly beat him by rockhard old fashion luck.


Goals:
- Host game on AWS,
- Private connection for a colleague and me.
- add chat?

- AI to get to play against computer
- DB for storing all choices and maybe use machine learning for creating better AI


styling
    - tilewrap (when only 1 tile wraps...)
    - animation when tile leaves and enters the table
    - dice animations
    - dice, tile and message sounds. (message types come in handy)
    - loginForm to create an actual player
    - background colors/doodles
    - sometimes we need a timeout to actualy see the dice combi before the script deletes everything

errors:
- many styling errors


optimalisations:
- cross browser checks
- make some choices for functionality. In the component or in the parent.
- a milion cases:
    if a player has a dice value higher then all tiles on the table but the oponent's top tile is higher then the players dice value But then again there are no dice combinations left to get to this value... This is not yet included
- many unique rare situations to be checked for
- message system needs to be re-checked. Can multiple messages occur? Is a timer needed?
- make a win system
