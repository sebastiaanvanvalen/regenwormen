# regenwormen-vue
// this is an application/game based on a existing real-life game. It's a project I use to get more familiar with VueJS(3) and VUEX(4). For now it will be a local game. But hosted on my server and with websockets I'll maybe make it a two player game on my portfolio.
// Hopefully the application is large enough to make good use of the composition API. It would also be nice if I find use for VUEX modules, the vue router and do some experiments with the VUE cli UI.
